#dotfiles

Enclosed are my configuration files and shell-scripts. Most of the code's
home-brewed, but I've borrowed large portions from forums, blogs, and wikis.

### Installation
The enclosed installation script will handle all `symlink` creation, and other
necessary setup.

```
python setup.py
```
