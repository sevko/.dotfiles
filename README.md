# dotfiles
This repo contains my various dotfiles and convenience tools/scripts. Most of it's custom-made but I've borrowed large
portions from forums, blogs, and wikis.

### installation
The enclosed installation script will `symlink` dotfiles from their expected locations on disk to the ones in this
repo.

```
python setup.py
```
