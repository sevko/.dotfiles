# description

The files in this directory are for use by the `remark` text-highlighting utility. Each is named after the tool it's
meant to be used with; `sdcv.remark`, for instance, contains regex-matches for the output of the `sdcv` dictionary
tool, `ping.remark` contains highlighting rules for `ping`, and so on.
